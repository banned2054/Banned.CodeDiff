# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Banned.CodeDiff

- Initial implementation of the core logic library, ported from
  [`@git-diff-view/core`](https://github.com/MrWangJustToDo/git-diff-view) and `fast-diff@1.3.0`:
  - Unified diff parsing (`RawDiff`, multi-file / multi-hunk, CRLF, no-newline markers, binary
    markers, bidi detection)
  - Split / unified line models with expandable hunks (up / down / all, configurable step,
    `Updated` notification)
  - Word-level change ranges from two algorithms (relative-changes and fast-diff), behind the
    `TemplateOptions` global switches
  - Language detection via `DiffTool.GetLang`
- 577 unit and golden tests comparing field-by-field against the JS original.

### Banned.CodeDiff.Avalonia

- In development (M2): minimal split view rendering — not yet published.
